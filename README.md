## Abstract:

<p align="justify">This project consists of using multi-objective goal-programming non-linear optimization technics to create stock portfolio maximizing valuation return while minimizing both volatility and unsystematic risk. This project was conducted from September 2022 to December 2022 as a student at <b>Ivey Business School</b>. Below are a few paragraphs to give you context about the project.</p> 

## Repository Assets:

- [Goal-Programming Portfolio Optimization Model](model/) - [Full Code](model/goal-programming-portfolio-optimization.ipynb)
- [Datasets](data/)

## Business Context:

<p align="justify"> <b>Quantitative Finance</b> overlaps heavily with <b>Operations Research</b>. Indeed, <b>Mathematical Optimization</b> serves investors well in improving their <b>Portfolio Management</b> practices. We will address the need for minimization of the unsystematic risk in portfolio-building pointed out by the Covid-19-related financial crisis, while addressing the classic risk-return trade-off respictively assessed as volatility and capital valuation.</p>

## Problem Description:

<p align="justify"> In this project, we will use the CPLEX Solver for the Linear-Programming and use a derivative of the <b>Stochastic Gradient Descent Algorithm</b> to optimize Non-Linear-Programming models proposed by SciPy as Sequential Least Square Programming. Finally we will proceed to Monte-Carlo Randomized-Blocked-Bootsrapping for the Cross-Validation stage. </p>
